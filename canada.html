    <h2>Origins</h2>
  <p>Canada started off as a group of colonies, mainly from Britain and France. The five original colonies were British Columbia, Newfoundland, Nova Scortia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, and the Province of Canada consisting of both Ontario and Quebec. Many of these colonies met together in conferences in order to collaborate with each other.  </p>
